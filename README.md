# Find-Dining

## Specification

Create a web application that allows users to find nearby restaurants.

## Tech

We're using Next.js and React.js for the frontend and Strapi for the backend.

## Before Working

Always use 'git pull' before working to get the latest version.
Always use 'npm i' to install the latest dependencies.
Always make a separate branch and create a pull request when working.

## To Install

Install node.
Install ES7 React from extensions.

## Formatting Rules

Type in terminal "npm i -g prettier" without the double quotes (will install an auto formatter that will format on save).
Functions not classes.
Components named with Capital Letters (PASCAL CASE) e.g. Component.jsx
Variables are camelCase e.g. firstButton.
Global classes are lower case with dashes e.g. upper-case.
Component specific are the name of Component then double space and the name of the class e.g. ComponentName\_\_Title.
Pages should be named lowercase (for routing purposes).
Components uppercase.

## Folder Structure

Public for images and designs.
Styles are for css files. (If you want to make a css file for each component that is okay.)
Pages store pages.
Components store components.
